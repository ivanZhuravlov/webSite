<h2>Catholic Clergy Abuse Scandals in the United States</h2>

<h3>The following video shows the distribution of Catholic-Clergy sexual abuse scandals over space and time. Each dot denotes the place and time of publication of the first news article accusing a given clergyman. Red dots correspond to type-A scandals, and blue dots correspond to type-B scandals. A brief definition of each type of scandal is given below the video. The color of each state corresponds to the log of the density of catholic adherents per square mile as of 1980. See the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1922950">paper</a> for further details.</h3>

<h3><b>Type-A scandal:</b> A clergyman who is currently working in a Catholic institution is accused of sexual abuse, no matter whether he or she committed the abuse in that same institution or some other institution. The location of the scandal is given by the address of the institution where the clergyman is working at the time of being publicly accused. The date of the scandal is given by the date of the first article mentioning the abuse, as long as the newspaper has a circulation that covers the location of the scandal.</h3>
<h3><b>Type-B scandal:</b> A clergyman is accused of having abused while working in the institution in the past, even if he or she is not working at that same institution at the time of the public accusation. The location of the scandal is given by the address of the institution where the clergyman allegedly committed the abuse. The date of the scandal corresponds to the date of the first newspaper article mentioning the abuse, as long as the newspaper has a circulation that covers the location of the scandal.</h3>
